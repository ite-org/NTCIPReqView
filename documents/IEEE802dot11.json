      "text": "This group contains the current list of requests for RM reports to be issued and have been issued until removed. A network manager adds a RM request by creating a row with createAndWait row status and then filling in the request parameters/attributes. The request becomes active to be issued when the row status is set to Active. The columnar objects or attributes other than the rowStatus are not written if the rowStatus is Active. The request rows can be deleted, if commanded by a network manager via changing the value of dot11RMRqstRowStatus to Destroy. This may leave orphaned rows if a manager crashes and forgets which rows are being used by it. One recommended way to manage orphaned or finished rows is to delete rows if their dot11RMRqstRowStatus remains other than Active for longer than a period (recommend at least 5 minutes, IETF RFC 2579). Or another recommended way is to delete older rows as needed based on their dot11RMRqstTimeStamp values. This can be done by the agent as well as the manager. ",
